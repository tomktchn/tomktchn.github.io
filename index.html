        <h2 class="header50px">Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Tom, a game developer currently learning C++ so that I can start to code my own games. I'm also learning HTML and Javascript so I can create websites like this :). I've made this website to showcase the projects I'm currently working on and I'll try to post regular updates when I make progress.
        </p>
        <h2>What am I up to?</h2>
        <p>
            You can see all of my current and past projects on the projects page. Clicking on each project will give you a bit more information, some concept art and things like that. Although I'm currently learning C++ as I mentioned above, mainly so I can start creating games using Unity and Xcode.
        </p>
