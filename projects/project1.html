    <h1>Project #1 - My Website</h1>

    <h2>What this website runs on</h2>

    <p>This website was created from scratch and i'm using Github Pages to host it. If you're interested in hosting your own website, I highly recommend using Github Pages as a hosting platform; it's free, fairly easy to get your head around, and you can customise it as much as you want. You can also redirect it to a custom domain like I have for this website. You can find out more about Github Pages <a class="linked" href="https://pages.github.com/">here</a> and you can view the repository for this website <a class="linked" href="https://github.com/tomktchn/tomktchn.github.io/">here</a>.

    <h2>Setting up the site</h2>

    <p>
        Setting up this website was a bit of a challenge as I had been looking for a free way to host it for some time. I had never used Github and was relatively new to writing in HTML when I stumbled across an article that mentioned Github Pages, so I decided to try it out. Setting up an account was a breeze but getting used to and learning how the repositories and merge requests worked took a bit of time.</p>

    <p>
        After about two days, I had got the website repository set up and started adding the pages, and now here we are. You are reading this on a website I made (woo!). I'm probably going to be continually updating and changing this website as my knowledge of HTML and CSS grows, maybe even one day i'll add in some Javascript :).
